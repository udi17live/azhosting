                <p>By default, customers do receive any system updates, such as newsletters, invoices, and service email notifications.

                    <h3>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
                </div>
                <p>We collect information globally and primarily store that information in the United States. We transfer, process, and store your information outside of your country of residence. Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it.</p>
                <p>To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information to the United States and allow access to that information from countries in which we and associated companies have operations for the purposes described in this policy. These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws, certainly not equivalent to the laws of many of the countries where our customers and users are based. When we share information about you, we make use of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for data transfers between EU and non-EU countries, which have been approved by the European Commission.</p>
                <p>A copy of your personal data will also be stored in the data center you have selected when signing up for our services. This is done so that Azpire Hosting can deliver the contracted service in the location specified by the customer.</p>
